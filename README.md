MyPromiSql
===

An internal library for use in My Local London.  We tried using https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql-promise
and it solved our immediate problems but wasn't particularly pleasant to work with.  This wrapper
avoids some duplication which has been cropping up.

If this is a library you'd benefit from please email mat@my-local.london and we can publish to NPM.
We won't bother to publish or maintain if there's no other users.
